Hi everyone,

I am reading a binary file completely, but I would like to restart reading the file, by moving to the beginning of the file again. I have tried using file.seekg(0, ios::beg); but it doesn't seem to work.

In a readfile function I read the file once, and it works.

[CODE]
    vector<uint32_t> buf(numcols);

    if(file.is_open())
    {
        while (file.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&buf[0]), sizeof(uint32_t)*numcols))
        {
            for(size_t i = 0; i < numcols; ++i)
            {
                freq[i][buf[i]]++;
            }
        }
    } 

    file.seekg(0, ios::beg);    // This supposedly brings the pointer to the beginning  of the file again.
[/CODE]

in another function I try:

[CODE]
 while (file.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&buf[0]), sizeof(uint32_t)*numcols))
        {
            for(size_t i = 0; i < numcols; ++i)
            {
                freq[i][buf[i]]++;
            }
        }
[/CODE]

but strange numbers indicate that it isn't actually reading the file from the beginning.

Ted.
